      GitHub is your digital storefront in the tech world. It's the first
      impression for potential employers gauging your skills.
    </p>
    <p>To shine on GitHub, follow this blueprint:</p>
    <ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-inside mb-20">
      <li>
        <b class="pt-4 pb-1 text-blue-600">Consistent Contributions</b>: From
        day one, aim for at least one daily commit. Whether it's a major update
        or a mere comment, consistency is key. If the terminal intimidates you,
        the GitHub GUI is your ally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="pt-4 pb-1 text-blue-600">Three/Four Pinned Projects</b>:
        Showcase your versatility with three primary projects. Ideally, these
        represent diverse abilities: a frontend project with an API, an
        e-commerce venture, and a full-stack endeavor with authentication and a
        database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="pt-4 pb-1 text-blue-600">Detailed Readme.md</b>: These should
        be your project's storybook. Start with an abstract, delve into the
        problem, your solutions, the technologies used, challenges faced, and a
        reflection. Conclude with a link to the live project.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b class="pt-4 pb-1 text-blue-600">Personable Profile</b>: Grace your
        GitHub with a professional photo. Align your bio with your portfolio -

            I am a self-taught React developer who began coding three years ago during
            the pandemic. To enhance my skills, I recently completed a frontend development
            bootcamp. Throughout my journey, I've successfully crafted numerous applications,
            one of which caught the attention of a prominent web3 marketing agency
            called Darknight Labs. They acquired my mint tracking tool, which has
            become a valuable asset for their portfolio. Darknight Labs boasts an
            impressive clientele, including established web2 companies like L'Or√©al
            and Assassin's Creed, as well as prominent web3 projects such as Alex
            Becker's Neo Tokyo, vVv, and Steady Stack.
            <br class="mb-2" />
            I am excited to progress in my career and believe your company aligns
            perfectly with my aspirations. Your exceptional culture and growth opportunities
            make me a valuable addition to your team. Thank you for considering my

            your projects.

            In addition to this accomplishment, I am also part of a web3 agency called
            Zylar. Our expertise lies in creating fully functional and visually stunning
            websites infused with web3 functionality. Our services cater to the evolving
            demands of the modern digital landscape, bridging the gap between traditional
            web2 companies and the innovative world of web3.

        class="text-blue-600">COMMUNICATION</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      When scores of applicants match your coding prowess and portfolio depth,
      what truly distinguishes you? <i
        >It's your ability to <b class="text-blue-600">communicate</b></i

      seal the deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always remain gracious, whether it's a triumph or a setback. Sprinkle your
      interactions with kindness - a simple "Thank you for the chance" or "Hope
      your week's off to a great start" can be transformative. Display warmth,
      receptiveness, and perhaps a touch of humor - these can be the intangibles
      that land you that role. Also, feedback is inevitable; embrace it with
      humility and gratitude.
    </p>

      Remember, you're navigating early in your developer journey, and feedback
      will be your frequent companion. So, keep the energy positive. Consider
